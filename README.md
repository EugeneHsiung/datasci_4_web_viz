## challenges encountered

### Shiny Python: 
One problem I encountered was trying to deploy the app. During my first attempt, I used the command
```pip install shiny``` which had no problems. However, after using  ```shiny run cd --reload```  error messages would pop up.

After retrying several times, I decided to save all and reload the entire google shell. I reran ```pip install shiny``` and ```shiny run cd --reload``` This time I was able to successfully deploy the app.

### Flask: 
The only problem that I had with Flask was creating a folder named ```Templates``` instead of ```templates```. However, after realizing the case sensitivity, I was able to successfully deploy the app.py

### Shiny R
I ran into a few problems with the Shiny R application on Postit cloud following https://docs.posit.co/shinyapps.io/getting-started.html#working-with-shiny-for-r .  First I did not realize that I had to install the packages: dplyr, ggplot2, and shiny. After clicking on the packages and running the application, I was able to successfully create an application.
